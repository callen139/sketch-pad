# sketch-pad
The Odin Project JavaScript/jQuery project to create a sketchpad.
 Instructions can be found here: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav

This is my own implementation of the project, each student of The Odin Project should have a slightly different outcome because the code isn't handed to us, just the instructions.
